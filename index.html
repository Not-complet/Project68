                    <p>APEX started this week! We hope that your child has talked to you about APEX. Normally, our Mustangs would run laps on the field to help our school earn monetary donations for PTC. This year, our Mustangs will be participating in the APEX Remix. Apex’s leadership program focuses on developing student self-control and interpersonal skills vital for school and life success. This year’s MIGHTY theme will take students on an exciting journey as they learn the different habits it takes to be a MIGHTY leader!</p>
